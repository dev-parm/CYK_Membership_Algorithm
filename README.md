# CYK_Membership_Algorithm
This program is a Python implementation of the famous Cocke–Younger–Kasami Algorithm or better known as, the CYK Algorithm.
This program uses a dictionary to store a Context Free Grammar in Chomsky Normal Form
The algorithm takes an input string w and outputs whether the string is a MEMBER of the Grammar in the dictionary
Note that the CYK algorithm only works with Context Free Grammar that is in Chomsky Normal Form
