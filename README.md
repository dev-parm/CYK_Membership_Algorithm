# CYK_Membership_Algorithm
This program is the implemented CYK Algorithm in python.
This program uses a dictionary to store a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form
The algorithm takes an input string w and outputs whether the string is a MEMBER of the grammar in the dictionary
Note that the CYK algorithm only works with Context Free Grammar that is in Chomsky Normal Form
